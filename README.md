# graduation_project
These are things that we have to consider to build this projects.

##**RESTful API Design**
This is because it is hard to modify kernel or router's IP stack code. So, we use RESTful API as a CDN.

##**Create associative networks**
This is the networks for multicasting and who are interested in searching content. Clients are only search their contents only on these network.

##**Design contents data structure in AP**
If there are many available contents list on certain AP, we have to define well-defined data structure to search it fast.

##**Define when to give up waiting for searching contents**
How can clients know when to give up waiting for searching contents that clients want.

##**What mechanism should we have to use to travel associative networks**
e.g., multicasting search or network by network(if there is no content then, AP gives its responsibility to another AP) search.


The things that we have resolved.
